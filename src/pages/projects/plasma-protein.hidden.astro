        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            Multiple risk factors (RFs) are associated with RCC, but the molecular pathways linking them to disease are not fully understood.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plasma proteins can act as intermediate biomarkers and be considered as potential therapeutic targets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Genetic evidence can help distinguish proteins that likely be upstream mediators from those that are reactive correlates.
          </li>
          <li>
            This project prioritizes proteins that plausibly mediate RF effects on RCC using converging evidence from independent in-silico analyses.
          </li>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Methods</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            Assembled genetic association evidence for RFs from different cohorts and the largest-to-date GWAS (N = 864,690; cases = 29,020) for RCC. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Identified plasma protein signals associated with RFs and/or RCC in UK Biobank (2,940 proteins, N = 34,557).
          </li>
          <li>
            Prioritized potential mediators based on consistent evidence across cis-MR, colocalization, and differential gene expression.
          </li>
          <li>
            Used colocalization analyses to assess whether protein and RCC associations share a causal variant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrated differential gene expression (DGE) evidence to contextualize candidates in tumor vs. normal tissue settings from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            Identified 33 PPs whose levels were genetically influenced by at least one of 19 RCC RFs and which in turn showed evidence of an effect on RCC. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Ranked candidate proteins supported by convergent evidence from genetic association, colocalization, and differential gene expression analyses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Three proteins were prioritized through consistent evidence from in-silico analyses. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Produced interpretable biological narratives linking RFs to protein pathways and RCC mechanisms.

          <li>
            A novel approach – proteome-wide mediation landscape that links RFs to downstream proteomic agents.
          </li>
          <li>
            RF first approach – illuminate the chain of causation from RF to cancer via molecular intermediaries.
          </li>
          <li>
            The resulting prioritized proteins provide candidates for downstream functional validation and translational follow-up.
