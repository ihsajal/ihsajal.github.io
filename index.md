# About Me
I’m Ibrahim Hossain Sajal, originally from Dhaka, Bangladesh, completed my Bachelors and Masters in Science in Applied Statistics at the University of Dhaka. I moved to Dallas, Texas on August 2019, to pursue my PhD in Statistical Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, where my research focused on developing advanced Bayesian methods for genetic association studies. In particular, I developed the bivariate quantitative Bayesian LASSO to detect rare haplotype associations with correlated phenotypes. I’ve also developed personalized contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk prediction models to support decision-making for two subgroup of breast cancer patients: Black patients and patients considering contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.

After completing my PhD, I moved to Germantown, Maryland on January 2025, to join the National Cancer Institute as a postdoctoral fellow at the Integrative Tumor Epidemiology Branch, under the mentorship of Dr. Diptavo Dutta. My current work combines integrative multi-omics and statistical genetics approaches to better understand cancer risk and the biological pathways that link risk factors to renal cell carcinoma. 

Outside of research, I’m passionate about exploring national parks, hiking scenic trails, and experimenting in the kitchen. I’m also a big fan of friendly competition on the FIFA pitch—though my virtual soccer skills are sometimes better than my real-life ones!
